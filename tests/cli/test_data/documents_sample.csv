1413,2093,Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures,"This Law is one of the two key climate laws in Japan along with the Energy Conservation Law. The purpose of the Law is to reduce emissions of GHGs derived from anthropogenic activities. GHGs are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, HFC, PFC and sulphur hexafluoride. The Council of Ministers for Global Environmental Conservation is established under the Law. The Council is chaired by the Prime Minister, and vice-chairmen are the Chief Cabinet Secretary, Minister of the Environment and Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry. Other members consist of all ministers other than vice-chairmen.  Designated emitters, whose workplaces contain more than 1,500kL of oil equivalent of energy annually, are mandated to develop the Plan for Global Warming Countermeasure. While there is no reduction obligation under this law, annual emission of GHGs are reported to the Minister in charge. Emission reporting under this framework equals that of the reporting under the Energy Conservation Law.  This Law stipulates that the State is responsible for implementing necessary measures to introduce Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) in Japan. It adds that examination and discussion of the design and the utilization of ETS starts upon the enactment of this Law.  This Law also provides that the national and local governments are responsible for development and implementation of plans to reduce GHG emissions.  The National Government adopted the Plan for Global Warming Countermeasures in May 2016, with the explicit aim to achieve the mid-term target set in Japan's INDC (2015) 26% GHG emissions reduction by 2030 (baseline 2013). In addition, the Plan also sets a long term goal of 80% GHG emissions reduction by 2050.  Prefectural and municipal governments are also required to create local plans to reduce GHG emissions.

1031,0,Carbon Farming Initiative Amendment Bill 2014,"This bill establishes the Emissions Reduction Fund, and provides a transition for the Carbon Farming Initiative by amending the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011 to provide for the Clean Energy Regulator to conduct auctions and enter into contracts to purchase emissions reductions; enable a broader range of emissions reduction projects to be approved; and amend the project eligibility criteria and processes for approving projects and crediting carbon credit units.<br />
<br />
The Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011 set up a scheme for the issue of Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) in relation to eligible offsets projects. It was part of a package of three Acts to establish the Carbon Farming Initiative, including the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011 and the Carbon Credits (Consequential Amendments) Act 2011.

1647,2254,Act On The Allocation And Trading Of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits,"The Act aims to achieve the national targets for reducing GHGs by introducing a system for trading GHG allowances through market mechanisms. The first phase of the trading scheme is due to start in 2015, covering companies that emit 125,000 metric tonnes or more of CO2 a year and factories, buildings and livestock farms that produce at least 25,000 tonnes of the gas annually.  The basic plan for the emissions rights trading system shall be established every 5 years for a unit period of 10 years. An Emissions Rights Allocation Committee chaired by the Minister of Strategy and Finance will be established for deliberation and mediation of major issues regarding the emissions rights trading system. The competent authorities will allocate the total emissions rights for the unit period and for each year to relevant corporations. The emissions rights may be traded. Anyone who wants to trade their rights shall enter an account in the emissions rights register.  The scheme determines that in the event that a corporation produces more GHGs than its allotted amount, the excess will be subject to a penalty of up to three times the average market price of the year, up to a limit of KRW100,000 (USD89.87) per one tonne of CO2.  The Enforcement Decree outlines the rules and governance structure for the ETS, planned to begin on 1 January 2015. The ETS requires each company or organisation to set the goal of emissions reduction and fulfill the required reduction goal by utilising a market mechanism. All six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are included, and the scheme covers direct and indirect emissions from individual facilities producing over 25ktCO2e/yr, companies with multiple installations producing over 125ktCO2e/yr, and any other firm that voluntarily wishes to join the ETS.  The Minister of Environment is responsible for controlling and operating the ETS. It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account.  During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction.  Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG. The specific criteria and procedures for the approval and certification of international offsets are yet to be established.  The government agency in charge can receive applications from qualified organisations and may select the emissions trading system's exchange among them through the evaluation of the Committee on Green Growth. In order to stabilise the market at an initial stage, companies will be subject to quota assignment through Phases I and II. When necessary, the government agency in charge, through the quota committee, will take measures to stabilise the market: adding up to 25% of the allowance reserve, specifying the minimum and maximum of emissions rights to be held, restricting borrowing and carry-over, and restricting the limit of offset emissions right's offers.  Financial support measures are allowed to industries whose competitiveness is negatively affected by the scheme.

1080,4597,Law relating to the coordination of the federal sustainable development policy,"The latest version of the Act on Co-ordination of Federal Policy on Sustainable Development calls for the development of a long-term vision for Sustainable Development that would include goals for 2050 and be based on interdepartmental and vertical co-operation among between the federal level and federated entities through the specifically created Interdepartmental Commission on Sustainable Development. A Federal Sustainable Development Plan is regularly elaborated and lays down specific co-ordination measures. So far, two FSDPs have been adopted, one for 2000-2004, the other for 2004-2008. The second FSDP has been extended due to the political context that prevented elaboration of a Plan for 2008-2012 and remains the current federal SD Plan. Three of the six main objectives of the FSDP are 'Managing natural resources more responsibly', 'Limiting climate change and increasing the use of clean energy', and 'Improving the transport system'. The measures proposed at the federal level in co-ordination with the regions include promoting alternative modes of transport, setting the right price for energy, promoting energy-conserving buildings and providing better public transport.",BEL,http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=fr&la=F&table_name=loi&cn=1997050535%20%20|fr,legislative,05/05/1997|Law passed||;25/12/2000|climate-relevant document adopted||;04/12/2014|Last amended||,Energy;Residential and Commercial;Transport,"Institutional mandates|Governance;Processes, plans and strategies|Governance;Subnational and citizen participation|Governance",,Mitigation,,Law,1997,French,Energy Supply;Energy Demand;Transport,,

It seeks to resolve Brazil's hydrological risk and create a new subsidy model to increase the attractiveness of renewable investments.<br />
Under the new law, the hydropower generating companies can protect themselves against droughts with the permission to buy and stock renewable energy, in a similar fashion to reserve energy auctions. For generators of solar, wind, biomass and cogeneration power, the government can now also provide rebates of up to 50 per cent in transmission and distribution tariffs.<br />
The law also lowers the usage fee for new plants of auto-generation renewable systems and facilitates reorganisation of shareholding of special purpose entities to drive investments in new renewable power plants.",BRA,https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBaGdJIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--2d3bca509b3e510e8f66a0964726cac80bc08bfa/f|,legislative,08/12/2015|Law passed,Energy;Water,Capacity building|Governance,,Mitigation,,Law,,,Energy Supply,Brazil,

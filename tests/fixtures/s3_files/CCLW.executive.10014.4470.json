The ideal solution to this would be the removal of interdisciplinary barriers and integration of environmental training and education issues into school curriculum. The proposed approach seems to be the most effective one as environmental education involves not merely the accumulation of information, but also environmental protection activities, an appropriate attitude towards nature and awareness on nature-human-nature interrelations."

Formal educational institutions play an important role in capacity development at an early age, providing knowledge and influencing attitudes and behavior of the pupils. It is important to ensure a good knowledge base regarding environmental protection for all pupils and students, teachers, directors and parents, so that they would be aware of the effects of the decisions that are contrary to sustainable development. In addition to formal education, non-formal education emphasizes participation and promotes a life-long learning process. Informal education takes place at the workplace, adding value to both employees and employers' education. Therefore, cooperation between actors involved in various forms of environmental and sustainable development education is to be recognized, encouraged and promoted."

This will be done in order to improve the authorization system for activities and to simplify the authorization procedure. Consequently, there will be no separate authorization systems for each activity regarding handling of natural resources (air, water, soil, waste, etc.) and there will be only two types of authorizations, depending on the significance of environmental impact. As such, there will be integrated environmental authorizations for industrial installations with significant environmental impact, and the implementation of new authorization system will be ensured by the mechanism of environmental impact assessment."

Soil quality monitoring is conducted within a national surveillance network, maintained by the State Hydrometeorological Service, established on the basis of 9 localities where soil samples are taken, summarily, from 6257 ha of agricultural land (in spring before sowing crops and in autumn after harvest), and the subsequent analysis are effectuated by a number of indicators (heavy metals, pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, petroleum products, agrochemical indices, etc.). In addition, complex analyses are performed for sediments from rivers and artificial lakes, for soil along the railways, around pesticide deposits and from Chisinau parks and squares in order to determine the extent of contamination with chloral organic pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals, petroleum products. The Ministry of Health monitors soil quality in recreational areas around the settlements, schools and playgrounds and in the areas surrounding drinking water sources. The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry supervises the quality of agricultural land, particularly for pesticide residues, whereas the \"Moldova's Waters\" Agency ensures monitoring of irrigated areas. But despite all the measures taken in this respect, the system of soil quality monitoring is very weak, and data about the level of soil fertility are very outdated."

The Ministry of Health manages several environmental quality laboratories for air, water and soil in all districts of the country, as well as in cities of Chisinau and Balti.

Currently 15 national standards of air and soil quality and 57 standards of water quality are applied. Although there is some progress in the process of harmonization of national environmental quality standards with international ones, particularly water quality standards (for surface, drinking water), which were established with the adoption of the Water Law and approbation of the mechanism for its implementation, for some environmental components old standards are still used. There is no registered progress on air quality standards, but international projects implemented over recent years are strongly focused on reviewing and harmonizing them. As a result, the number of parameters under monitoring has been reduced considerably and, gradually, new parameters were introduced in line with EU and international requirements. However, the process of environmental quality standards harmonization needs to be continued and intensified."

Rainwater resulting from precipitation comes in contact with the ground and, in the process of runoff, meets with wastewater spills, waste, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, so that at the moment of discharge it contains a large number of pollutants. The imminent danger for underground water is represented by abandoned artesian wells, usually having a deteriorated casing or an opened wellhead, which results in the mix of rainwater with the deep one and decrease of water-bearing strata quality."

Organization of agricultural land has to provide for ensuring effective soil protection, which is quite difficult to accomplish in conditions of land fragmentation and parceling. From these considerations it is needed to promote the policy of \"consolidation\" of parceled agricultural land, which lies in creating opportunities for antierosional organization, implementation of crop rotation and regional systems for efficient use and protection of soil. Consolidation can also be performed in terms of privatization - value shares and private parcels can be incorporated into a massive organized by antierosional principles, compelling owners to respect common rules of land use and soil protection technologies. A system of grants and subsidies will be developed to contribute to rational use and protection of soil resources; irrigation will be promoted and encouraged for a wide range of farms with various management types in viable zones."

Some studies estimate illegal logging in volume of about 400-600,000 m3 annually. b) Green spaces in urban and rural localities used for recreation constitute 21,553,56 ha, including: of general purpose - 6,790,560 ha, of limited access - 3,166,290 ha, with special profile - 106,170 ha, with utility functions - 9,805,700 ha, and touristic area - 36,43 ha. Nowadays a massive reduction of green spaces is taking place due to their conversion into areas occupied by constructions. Considerable areas of green spaces of the Republic of Moldova are sold or leased. The degradation draws in many green spaces adjoining water basins, as well as in squares between quarters and municipal parks. Apart from reducing the territory covered by vegetation, green spaces pollution is another serious environmental problem. Restriction of green spaces increases urban environmental risks, having an immediate negative impact on their viability and sustainability, on the quality of life and health condition of the population."

The process of degradation of natural and manmade ecosystems has a significant influence on the richness of the animal world. Forest ecosystems provide animals with variable living conditions, but essential forest fragmentation reduces the possibility of population exchange between them. Along with the reduction of forest areas and intensification of excessive grazing in meadow and steppe ecosystems, some species of rodent mammals have become vulnerable and rare. The reduction of rodents, an important link in the food chain, led, in turn, to reduction and even disappearance of certain species of carnivorous mammals, 6 species (of the existing 14) being already included in the Red Book of Moldova."

In 2013, the first national park of the Republic of Moldova was created - the \"Orhei\" National Park.

Under the Convention on Climate Change, Moldova's commitment is to realize climate change mitigation measures focused on reducing, at the national level, of total greenhouse gas emissions by no less than 20% as compared to the basic year (1990) by 2020. In order to achieve the commitments, the Republic of Moldova will implement efficient measures of greenhouse gases emission reduction through the potential of improving energy efficiency, especially in the following sectors: energy, industry, agriculture and waste management. The first decisional action is the elaboration of strategic and institutional framework in the field of climate change mitigation and adaptation, elaboration of climate change adaptation measures for all branches of the national economy."

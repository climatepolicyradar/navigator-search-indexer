This was affirmed\nby the 15th African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) that, in the build-up to\nthe Paris Agreement of December 2015, called for \"a global goal for adaptation which takes into\naccount adaptation needs and associated costs, including support for developing countries, while\nrecognizing the need to increase adaptation investments in developing nations\" and \"an ambitious\nglobal mitigation action in the long-run, combined with large-scale, rapidly increasing and\npredictable funding for adaptation.\"\u00b9 AMCEN recommended that investment in building resilience\nmust continue to be a top funding priority, including as an integral part of national development\nplanning. This resonates well with Kenya's approach of mainstreaming climate adaptation in national\nand county (sub-national) development planning."

It is in this respect that it launched\na National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS) in 2010 and a National Climate Change\nAction Plan (NCCAP 2013-2017) in 2013. The action plan has been acclaimed internationally as\nbeing very progressive and comprehensive. The action plan is clear that adaptation is the main\npriority for the country because of the adverse socio-economic impacts related to climate change\nbeing experienced and the ever increasing vulnerabilities of the different sectors. The NCCAP clearly\narticulates that sustainable development is difficult to achieve in light of a changing climate that has\nnegative economic, social, and environmental impacts; meaning that adaptation and development\ngoals need to complement each other. Kenya's recommended approach for addressing climate\nchange is mainstreaming of climate change actions in development planning, budgeting and\nimplementation."

Details of this structure can be found in the\nEnabling Legislative and Institutional Framework Report.\" Among the report's key recommendations\nwere comprehensive institutional reforms, including the establishment of a National Climate Change\nCouncil domiciled in the Office of the President, a Climate Change Directorate under the ministry\nresponsible for climate affairs, and a Technical Advisory Committee within the proposed Directorate.\nThe NCCAP also recommended the establishment of a Kenya climate fund domiciled in the National\nTreasury.\" In order to achieve this, enactment of a framework climate change law encapsulating\nlegislative, policy and institutional recommendations was recommended."

They will be expected to report annually to the National Climate Change\nCouncil on the status and progress of climate change adaptation and resilience in the ASALS.\nPrivate sector: The council may, in consultation with the Cabinet Secretary (Climate Change\nAffairs) and relevant State Departments, impose climate change obligations on private entities,\nincluding entities constituted under the Public Benefits Organizations Act, 2013. The private\nsector has been impacted by climate variability and has suffered negative impacts of droughts\nand flood risks. They include: operational, supply chain and raw materials risk, water and energy\nsupply priorities, financial and market risks, agriculture, food security and rural development,\necosystem threats, poor infrastructure, unreliable weather information and public health. In\naddition, technical interpretation of climate change issues and in particular, climate change\nadaptation is not clear to the sector. There is need to develop a business case for private sector\ninvestment in adaptation. While 'climate proofing' of private sector investments is important,\nthere are also emerging business opportunities in helping communities to reduce their climate\nrisks such as provision of financial resources for adaptation through investments, financial risk\nmanagement, and the charitable provision of resources through foundations or corporate social\nresponsibility. This sector also plays an enormous role in awareness raising and information\nbuilding hence the need for their engagement in adaptation.\nMedia: The media can provide vital information at times of emergency - from warning of\nimminent floods to explaining how to deal with disease outbreaks. As such it is expected that the\nmedia will be involved in the dissemination of this NAP and disseminating its progress against\nthe key indicators measuring Kenya's adaptive capacity. Indeed, strategic actions that improve\nclimate change journalism can themselves be forms of adaptation because accurate, timely and\nrelevant information is a critical component of resilience.\u00b9\nAcademia and research institutions: This group of actors plays a key role in building the country's\nadaptive capacity. They will provide the evidence for knowledge based decision making by\nthe national and county governments, private sector, development partners and civil society\namongst others. This will be done through research conducted on different aspects of climate\nchange adaptation and resilience, including improving the understanding of climate change\nattribution in Kenya and providing information on the appropriate mix of adaptation actions in\norder to avoid maladaptation."

Annual\nrainy seasons in Kenya are becoming progressively wetter, with sudden and/or late onsets bringing with\nthem floods and inundation. Major floods periodically afflict the Winam Gulf of Lake Victoria, Lower\nTana basin and the coastal regions. Geographically, the western, northern, eastern, central and south-\neastern parts of the country are quite susceptible to seasonal floods in the wet seasons of March-April-May\nand October-November-December. Riverine floods are the most dominant floods in Kenya, although the\nASALS are particularly vulnerable to flash flooding. The economic costs of flooding to the country are very\nhigh, resulting to losses of 5.5 per cent of GDP every seven years (Figure 9). Flood-related fatalities in\nthe country constitute 60 per cent of disaster victims. During flood events there is often an upsurge in\nwaterbome or sanitation-related diseases, such as typhoid, cholera, malaria and diarrhoeal diseases."

                    "Kenya's coastline is 1,420 kilometres in length and sea level rise is a risk to five coastal counties and\ntheir populations. Climate change impacts, including increases in sea surface temperature, sea level\nrise and coastal erosion, are likely to put additional pressure on coastal economies, communities\nand ecosystems, including islands, estuaries, beaches, coral reefs and marine biodiversity. Sea\nlevel rise in combination with extreme weather events is likely to intensify flooding as most of\nthe coastland is low-lying, with the coastal city of Mombasa particularly exposed. It is estimated\nthat an area of 4-6 km\u00b2 in Mombasa is likely to be submerged with a rise in sea level of only 0.3\nmetres. In coastal locations, sea level rise is likely to render more acute the current water supply and\nsalinization problem, as freshwater aquifers are contaminated with saline water. Water logging of\nsoils and the resulting salt stress might cause reduced crop production. In addition, the health of\ncoastal populations could be affected because of increasing ground water salinity, which might also\nlead to permanent inundation of low lying areas making them uninhabitable, leading to migration\nof population and possibly the emergence of environmental refugees.\""
